# Note on Nextcloud

If you plan to use the Nextcloud AIO Docker Image to self host your Nextcloud Instance, it could be handy to add the Nginx Proxy Manager container into the Nextcloud Network.

This can easily be achieved by using the `docker-compose-Nextcloud.yml` file in the `Docker` folder of this service.
